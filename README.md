# Living Resume Platform

This repository contains a web-based application designed to act as a living resume and software engineering showcase.

The platform is intended to demonstrate practical skills in:
- Backend API development (Python)
- Frontend web application development (React)
- Micro-architecture and service separation
- Containerisation using Docker
- CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions
- Deployment to a public-facing environment

The project is developed incrementally using industry-standard software engineering practices and is intentionally structured to mirror real-world production systems.

This repository is a work in progress and will evolve over time as new features and architectural components are added.
